Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of death globally, claiming at least 20 million lives annually (WHO, 2021). While 80% of these deaths are preventable, progress has stalled in recent years. Factors such as limited access to healthcare and unhealthy lifestyles in low- and middle-income countries are reported to contribute to this (World Heart Report, 2023). Despite advancements in high-income countries, the global burden of CVD mortality remains concentrated in these regions. This disparity raises concerns about the availability of affordable treatments. To address this, scientists have focused on discovering low-cost therapies, with small molecule drugs emerging as a promising option. However, the discovery of small molecule therapeutics requires a compatible biological target. This has been a challenge in cardiovascular research, as potential targets, such as protein-protein interactions and epigenetic targets for CVDs, are often difficult to "drug." The current study analyses demographic data (age and sex) and health indicators (Glucose Levels, Cholesterol Levels, BMI, and lifestyle habits) of 70,000 participants to assess the impact of individual and combined factors on the risk of CVD.
